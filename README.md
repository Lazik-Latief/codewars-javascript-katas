# 🟡 Codewars JavaScript Practice

This repository contains my daily JavaScript practice solutions from the **Codewars** platform.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build consistency through daily practice
- Maintain a public record of my learning journey

I will regularly update this repository with new challenges and solutions as I progress.

##  Daily Practice Log

### Day 01 – JavaScript Basics
**Topic:** Arrays, Loops, Conditional Logic  
**Problem:** Count the number of sheep present in an array  

---

##  Problem: Counting Sheep

**Description:**  
Given an array of boolean values where:
- `true` represents a sheep present
- `false` represents a missing sheep  

The task is to count how many sheep are present in the array.

---

###  Solution Explanation

- An array contains `true` and `false` values.
- We initialize a counter variable (`count`) to keep track of sheep.
- Using a `for` loop, we iterate through the array.
- Every time we encounter `true`, we increment the counter.
- Finally, we print the total count.

###  Key Learnings
- How to iterate over arrays using loops
- How to use conditionals to check values
- Importance of correct loop conditions (`i < array.length`)
- Writing clean and readable JavaScript code

---
##  2nd Problem:
- Function to convert a boolean value into a string
- Input: true or false
- Output: "true" or "false"
---

##  3rd Problem:
## Codewars – DNA to RNA Transcription

- Implemented a function to convert DNA strings into RNA.  
- Replaced all occurrences of Thymine (`T`) with Uracil (`U`).  
- Practiced string manipulation in JavaScript.  
- Tested the solution with multiple examples.
